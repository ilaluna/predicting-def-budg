### Predicting a country's defense budget given its population, area and some economical aspects.

I am writing this project in order to get familiar with Python's main statistical and data science packages.

I will first perform some basic exploration of the dataset and then run a multivariate linear model in order to predict how much each contry spends on defense, based on some of its economical and size indicators.

The data I used is also available at:

Suggestions and improvements are more than welcome!
